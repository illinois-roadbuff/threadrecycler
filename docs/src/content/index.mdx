# ThreadRecycler

An efficient thread management module written in Luau for Roblox.

## Performance

ThreadRecycler optimizes thread usage by recycling, reducing resource consumption. 

Fewer resources are wasted on unnecessary threads, leading to faster execution. Additionally, it minimizes CPU usage ensuring better overall performance.

While ThreadRecycler helps optimize thread usage, it may depend the number of active threads. However, it should never lead to a decrease in performance.

[Benchmarks are coming soon]
