# Installation

<Steps>

### Installing via Github Releases

Head over to releases and download the `.rbxm` file from the latest version. Then, insert the `.rbxm` file into Roblox Studio. 
<Callout type="info">
    It's recommended to place the module under `ReplicatedStorage`, however you may place it wherever you'd like. 
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
    Although I may provide `.luau` or `.lua` files, it's not recommended to use them over `.rbxm` files in this case.
</Callout>

### Requiring ThreadRecycler and creating a thread pool

To use ThreadRecycler, require the module in your script. Then, create a `ThreadPool`:
```lua copy filename="client-or-server" {1}
local ThreadRecycler = require(game.GetService(game, "ReplicatedStorage").ThreadRecycler) -- p.s. .GetService is faster; Never knew that huh?
local ThreadPool = ThreadRecycler.erect() -- erect basically means to build or create
```
