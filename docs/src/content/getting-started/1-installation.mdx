# Installation

<Steps>

### Installing via Github Releases

Head over to releases and download the `.rbxm` file from the latest version. Then, insert the `.rbxm` file into Roblox Studio. 
<Callout type="info">
    It's recommended to place the module under `ReplicatedStorage`, however you may place it wherever you'd like. 
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
    Although I may provide `.luau` or `.lua` files, it's not recommended to use them over `.rbxm` files in this case.
</Callout>

### Requiring ThreadRecycler and creating a thread pool

To use ThreadRecycler, require the module in your script. Then, create a `ThreadPool` and set up your config:
```lua copy filename="client-or-server.luau"
local ThreadRecycler = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").ThreadRecycler) 
local ThreadPool = ThreadRecycler.erect({ -- erect basically means to build or create
	["InitialThreadCount"] = 60, -- Initial thread count 
	["CachedLifetime"] = 60,  -- Cached lifetime 
	["EnableStatRecording"] = true, -- Enables recording of stats 
	["Logger"] = warn, -- Log method; doesn't do anything right now. Coming in the future... 
	["Debug"] = false -- Debug configuration. Doesn't do anything right now. Coming in the future... 
})

```
