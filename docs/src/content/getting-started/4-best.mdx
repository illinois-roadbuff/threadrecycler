import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

## Example
```lua copy filename="example.luau"
local ThreadRecycler = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").ThreadRecycler)
local PoolConfig = {
	["InitialThreadCount"] = 10,
	["CachedLifetime"] = false,
	["EnableStatRecording"] = false,
	["Logger"] = warn,
	["Debug"] = false
}
local CoroutineThreadPool = ThreadRecycler.erect(PoolConfig)
local TaskThreadPool = ThreadRecycler.erect(PoolConfig) -- it would be best to keep them both separated

local function test(thread, x)
    print("Hello!")
    task.wait(1) -- should not cause any issues since wrap isn't in the task library
    print("Hello world after 1 second!")
    -- do some stuff; lets say that it may yield forever or never actually 'end'.
    CoroutineThreadPool.recycle(CoroutineThreadPool, thread) -- if so, then this would be needed to properly recycle the thread
end

TaskThreadPool.spawn(TaskThreadPool, function(thread)
    print("Hello world!")
    TaskThreadPool.wait(5) -- must be used instead of task.wait() to prevent task library issues
    print("Hello again after 5 seconds!")
end)

CoroutineThreadPool.wrap(CoroutineThreadPool, test, 1) 

--// Example of autocompatible
TaskThreadPool.autocompatible(TaskThreadPool, test, 1) -- ->  ThreadRecycler: This function supports auto-recycling!
-- If that statment never shows up, then you must manually recycle. 

```

## Best Practices
<Callout emoji="ðŸ“ƒ">
    Try to stick with `ThreadRecycler.wrap` or `ThreadRecycler.spawn` to prevent possible issues. Create different thread pools, separating `.wrap` and `.spawn`.
    Refrain from using unsafe functions as it may cause major issues. Use `ThreadRecycler.wait()` instead of `task.wait()` if you're not using `.wrap`.
</Callout>

As this is my first open-sourced module, if you have anything that I could improve on, I'd love to hear!
