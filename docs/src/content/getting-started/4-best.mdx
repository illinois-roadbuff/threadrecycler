import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

## Best Practices
<Callout emoji="ðŸ“ƒ">
    Try to stick with `ThreadRecycler.wrap` or `ThreadRecycler.spawn` to prevent possible issues.
    Refrain from using unsafe functions as it may cause major issues. Use `ThreadRecycler.wait()` instead of `task.wait()`.

As this is my first open-sourced module, if you have anything that I could improve on, I'd love to hear!
