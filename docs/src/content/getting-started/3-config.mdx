Updated for: threadrecycler@0.3.0-alpha.4

## Configuration
### External Configuration

You can edit your `ThreadPool` configuration by editing the table.

```lua copy filename="client-or-server.luau" {3-7}
local ThreadRecycler = require(game.GetService(game, "ReplicatedStorage").ThreadRecycler) -- p.s. .GetService is faster; Never knew that huh?
local ThreadPool = ThreadRecycler.erect({ 
	["InitialThreadCount"] = 60, -- Initial thread count 
	["CachedLifetime"] = 60,  -- Cached lifetime 
	["EnableStatRecording"] = true, -- Enables recording of stats 
	["Logger"] = warn, -- Log method; doesn't do anything right now. Coming in the future... 
	["Debug"] = false -- Debug configuration. Doesn't do anything right now. Coming in the future... 
})
```
### Internal Configuration
Some internal configs can be modified in the module, although it will only be applied if you leave `.erect()` blank:
```lua copy filename="ThreadRecycler.lua" {2-7}
local SETTINGS = {
	Default = {
		threadCount = 10 :: number, -- Default initial thread count 
		cachedtime = false :: number | boolean, -- Default cached lifetime 
		enableStatRecording = false :: boolean, -- Enables default recording of stats. Set to false if you don't want to use this.
		logger = warn :: () -> () , -- Default log method; doesn't do anything right now. Coming in the future... 
		debug = false :: boolean, -- Default debug configuration. Doesn't do anything right now. Coming in the future... 
	}
}
```
<Callout type="info">
    Changing the default thread count to a negative number can work.
</Callout>
